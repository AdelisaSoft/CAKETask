# Explanation
This repo is used to showcase results, thought process and everything realted to the task given by `CAKE`.

# Dependencies
All the needed dependencies are in `requirements.txt` and are easily installed. Navigate to the project folder using the following command in the Terminal `pip install -r "requirements.txt"`.

# Structure
Due to the fact that this task has limited time, we will have the following structure:
- `artifacts`: folder where the model will be exported and imported from
- `data`: folder where the data if generated from running the notebooks as well as the data for training
- `notebooks`: folder where we keep notebooks to execute the whole process (step by step) 
- `testing model`: folder where we will simulate process of calling the endpoint (in this case we will just import the model and make predictions)

# Future work
This can be upgraded into a clasicall endpoint, which will increase our model usability.
